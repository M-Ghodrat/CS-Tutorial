    "The way to actually delete or remove that file is using something called the `rm` command.\n",

    "## Delete Files\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "$user@computer-name:~$ rm file1.txt\n",
    "$user@computer-name:~$ rm file2.txt file2.txt /home/user/file3.txt\n",

    "To delete directories, you have to add `-r` option:\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "$user@computer-name:~$ rm dir1\n",
    "rm: cannot remove 'dir/': Is a directory\n",

    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note:** To ask shell to prompt before every removal, add `-i` option.\n",

    "Fortunately there's another command that specialized for only removing directories that are empty now because this command only removes empty directories. This means that you can tell it to delete everything. It will only delete the folders that are actually empty. Which means you'll never delete a file accidentally.\n",

    "```bash\n",
    "$user@computer-name:~$ rmdir delme\n",
    "rmdir: failed to remove 'delme': Directory not empty\n",

    "## Summary\n",
    "- The `rm` command needs `-r` option to delete folders (Be careful!).\n",
    "- The `i` option will allow the `rm` command to be **interactive** when deleting.\n",
    "- The `rmdir` command will only delete folders that are empty."
