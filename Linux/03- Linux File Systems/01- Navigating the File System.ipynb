    "# Navigating the File System\n",
    "\n",
    "## Where are we?\n",
    "The first thing we'd like to know when navigating the system is where we currently are.\n",
    "\n",
    "And the shell already tells us this with **shell prompt** and the shell prompt is everything up to the dollar sign.\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "$user@computer-name:~$\n",
    "```\n",
    "First of all it tells you the user who is logged in which is `user` on this computer. Then you have the name of the computer which is `computer-name`.\n",
    "\n",
    "And then you `~` that's called Tilda which is a short way of representing the current user's home directory.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can actually confirm at any time what directory or what location our shell is currently operating in but using the `pwd` command and the `pwd` command stands for **print working directory**.\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "$user@computer-name:~$ pwd\n",
    "/home/user\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The path starts all the way from the root directory the very base directory which is the `/` and works its way down until we get to the home directory for the user `user` which is the current user logged in.\n",
    "\n",
    "## How to Navigate\n",
    "Now that we know where we are and we know that our shell is operating inside of our home folder how can we take a look around and see what's in the home folder?\n",
    "\n",
    "### `ls`\n",
    "We need to use the `ls` command now the `ls` is short for the list and the `ls` command will list of files in a directory.\n",
    "\n",
    "|Command|Description|\n",
    "|:--|:--|\n",
    "|`ls`|List of files/directories in a directory|\n",
    "|`ls -F`|List files/directories with classification (directories appear with `/` at the end)|\n",
    "|`ls -l`|List of files/directories in **long format**|\n",
    "|`ls -lh`|List of files/directories in **human readable** long format (4096 will appear as 4K)|\n",
    "|`ls -a`|List of **all** (including hidden) files/directories|\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note:** Hidden files/directories start with a dot: `.`\n",
    "\n",
    "List of files/directories in long format:\n",
    "![ls-l](../images/ls-l.jpg)\n",
    "\n",
    "### `cd`\n",
    "How can we actually move from our home directory?\n",
    "\n",
    "The missing piece is the `cd` command and the `cd` command stands for **change directory**.\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "user@computer ~ % cd /home/user/Downloads\n",
    "user@computer ~/Downloads %         # directory is changed to ~/Downloads\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note:**\n",
    "- You can use **full path** (start at the base `/` directory such as `/home/user/`) or **relative path** (start at the current directory such as `./user`).\n",
    "- `.` means the current directory.\n",
    "- `..` means the parent folder or the folder above where we currently are.\n",
    "- `cd .` stays in the same directory.\n",
    "- `cd ..` changes directory to the parent directory.\n",
    "- Press tab for auto completion. For example type `cd ~/Do` and press tab to receive two suggestions.\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "user@computer ~ % cd /home/user/Do\n",
    "Downloads       Documents\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## Summary\n",
    "- You can use `pwd` command to see the path to where on the file system the shell is currently operating.\n",
    "- You use `ls` to see what's around you.\n",
    "- You can use the `cd` command to move to a new location on the file system.\n",
    "- **Absolute Path** start at the base (`/`) directory.\n",
    "- **Relative Path** start from the current directory.\n",
    "- Every directory has the `.` (current directory) and `..` (parent directory) hidden folders.\n",
    "- **Tab Auto Completion** is a really usefull technique to speed up typing and avoid errors.\n",
    "- Tab auto completion can be used **anywhere**, not just when navigating."
