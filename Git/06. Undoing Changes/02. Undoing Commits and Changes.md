# Undoing Commits and Changes

In this section, we will discuss the available 'undo' Git strategies and commands. It is first important to note that Git does not have a traditional 'undo' system like those found in a word processing application. It will be beneficial to refrain from mapping Git operations to any traditional 'undo' mental model. Additionally, Git has its own nomenclature for 'undo' operations that it is best to leverage in a discussion. This nomenclature includes terms like `reset`, `revert`, `checkout`, `clean`, and more.

A fun metaphor is to think of Git as a timeline management utility. Commits are snapshots of a point in time or points of interest along the timeline of a project's history. Additionally, multiple timelines can be managed through the use of branches. When 'undoing' in Git, you are usually moving back in time, or to another timeline where mistakes didn't happen.

This section provides all of the necessary skills to work with previous revisions of a software project. First, it shows you how to explore old commits, then it explains the difference between reverting public commits in the project history vs. resetting unpublished changes on your local machine.

## Finding what is lost: Reviewing old commits
The whole idea behind any version control system is to store “safe” copies of a project so that you never have to worry about irreparably breaking your code base. Once you’ve built up a project history of commits, you can review and revisit any commit in the history. One of the best utilities for reviewing the history of a Git repository is the `git log` command. In the example below, we use `git log` to get a list of the latest commits to a popular open-source graphics library.

Each commit has a unique SHA-1 identifying hash. These IDs are used to travel through the committed timeline and revisit commits. By default, `git log` will only show commits for the currently selected branch. It is entirely possible that the commit you're looking for is on another branch. You can view all commits across all branches by executing `git log --branches=*`. The command `git branch` is used to view and visit other branches. Invoking the command, `git branch -a` will return a list of all known branch names. One of these branch names can then be logged using `git log`.

When you have found a commit reference to the point in history you want to visit, you can utilize the git checkout command to visit that commit. Git checkout is an easy way to “load” any of these saved snapshots onto your development machine. During the normal course of development, the `HEAD` usually points to master or some other local branch, but when you check out a previous commit, `HEAD` no longer points to a branch—it points directly to a commit. This is called a **detached HEAD** state, and it can be visualized as the following:

Checking out an old file does not move the `HEAD` pointer. It remains on the same branch and same commit, avoiding a 'detached head' state. You can then commit the old version of the file in a new snapshot as you would any other changes. So, in effect, this usage of git checkout on a file, serves as a way to revert back to an old version of an individual file.

## Undoing a committed snapshot
There are technically several different strategies to 'undo' a commit. The following examples will assume we have a commit history that looks like:

```
git log --oneline
872fa7e Try something crazy
a1e8fb5 Make some important changes to hello.txt
435b61d Create hello.txt
9773e52 Initial import
```
We will focus on undoing the `872fa7e` Try something crazy commit. Maybe things got a little too crazy.

## How to undo a commit with `git checkout`
Using the git checkout command we can checkout the previous commit, `a1e8fb5`, putting the repository in a state before the crazy commit happened. Checking out a specific commit will put the repo in a "detached HEAD" state. This means you are no longer working on any branch. In a detached state, any new commits you make will be orphaned when you change branches back to an established branch. Orphaned commits are up for deletion by Git's garbage collector. The garbage collector runs on a configured interval and permanently destroys orphaned commits. To prevent orphaned commits from being garbage collected, we need to ensure we are on a branch.

From the detached `HEAD` state, we can execute `git checkout -b new_branch_without_crazy_commit`. This will create a new branch named `new_branch_without_crazy_commit` and switch to that state. The repo is now on a new history timeline in which the `872fa7e` commit no longer exists. At this point, we can continue work on this new branch in which the `872fa7e` commit no longer exists and consider it 'undone'. Unfortunately, if you need the previous branch, maybe it was your master branch, this undo strategy is not appropriate. Let's look at some other 'undo' strategies.

## How to undo a public commit with `git revert`
Let's assume we are back to our original commit history example. The history that includes the `872fa7e` commit. This time let's try a revert 'undo'. If we execute `git revert HEAD`, Git will create a new commit with the inverse of the last commit. This adds a new commit to the current branch history and now makes it look like:

At this point, we have again technically 'undone' the `872fa7e` commit. Although `872fa7e` still exists in the history, the new `e2f9a78` commit is an inverse of the changes in `872fa7e`. Unlike our previous checkout strategy, we can continue using the same branch. This solution is a satisfactory undo. This is the ideal 'undo' method for working with public shared repositories. If you have requirements of keeping a curated and minimal Git history this strategy may not be satisfactory.

## Undoing the last commit
In the previous section, we discussed different strategies for undoing commits. These strategies are all applicable to the most recent commit as well. In some cases though, you might not need to remove or reset the last commit. Maybe it was just made prematurely. In this case you can amend the most recent commit. Once you have made more changes in the working directory and staged them for commit by using `git add`, you can execute `git commit --amend`. This will have Git open the configured system editor and let you modify the last commit message. The new changes will be added to the amended commit.

## Undoing uncommitted changes
Before changes are committed to the repository history, they live in the staging index and the working directory. You may need to undo changes within these two areas. The staging index and working directory are internal Git state management mechanisms.

### Resetting, Checking Out & Reverting
Because they’re so similar, it’s very easy to mix up which command should be used in any given development scenario. In this section, we’ll compare the most common configurations of `git reset`, `git checkout`, and `git revert`.

<img src="../images/3-stages.png" alt="3-stages" width="400px" style="float: none;" />

A checkout is an operation that moves the `HEAD` ref pointer to a specified commit.

A revert is an operation that takes a specified commit and creates a new commit which inverses the specified commit. git revert can only be run at a commit level scope and has no file level functionality.

A reset is an operation that takes a specified commit and resets the "three trees" to match the state of the repository at that specified commit. A reset can be invoked in three different modes which correspond to the three trees. These trees are the Commit History (HEAD), the Staging Index, and the Working Directory.

Checkout and reset are generally used for making local or private 'undos'. They modify the history of a repository that can cause conflicts when pushing to remote shared repositories. Revert is considered a safe operation for 'public undos' as it creates new history which can be shared remotely and doesn't overwrite history remote team members may be dependent on.

#### Git Reset vs Revert vs Checkout reference
The table below sums up the most common use cases for all of these commands. Be sure to keep this reference handy, as you’ll undoubtedly need to use at least some of them during your Git career.

|Command|Scope|Common use cases|
|:--|:--|:--|
|git reset|Commit-level|Discard commits in a private branch or throw away uncommited changes|
|git reset|File-level|Unstage a file|
|git checkout|Commit-level|Switch between branches or inspect old snapshots|
|git checkout|File-level|Discard changes in the working directory|
|git revert|Commit-level|Undo commits in a public branch|
|git revert|File-level|(N/A)|

##### Commit Level Operations
The parameters that you pass to git reset and git checkout determine their scope. When you don’t include a file path as a parameter, they operate on whole commits. That’s what we’ll be exploring in this section. Note that git revert has no file-level counterpart.
